                                <strong>The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.</strong> The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.</p>
                            <p>
                                Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app (or part of it) lightly and with ease.
                                Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

                            <p>
                                In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

                                    Why You Should Care About Semantics: </strong>
                                The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is. That clarity is also communicated with search engines, ensuring that the right pages are delivered for the right queries.

                            <p>Compared to display: inline , the major difference is that <strong>inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.</strong> Also, with display: inline , top and bottom margins and paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element. It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore.

                                Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins and paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are.

                                Now, the difference between display: inline-block and display: block is that, with display: block, a line break happens after the element, so a block element doesnâ€™t sit next to other elements.
